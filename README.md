# CrossCode Extra Dialogue

![CrossCode Extra Dialogue Banner](docs/images/title.png)

This mod adds more lore-friendly dialogue for party members, that previously had no interactions with each other. 

Compared to original game + DLC, amount of post-combat party conversations is increased by **at least 4 times**.

*Note: 'A New Home' DLC is NOT required, although majority of new content is only available in post-game episode.*

# Extended Party Dialogue
![Extended party dialogue](docs/images/party_dialogue.png)

This mod features new dialogue for **16 different parties**, which were not covered by the original game. In other words, every pair of companions now has something to say to each other. 

*CrossCode Extra Dialogue* adds approximately 7500 words of text, which is almost a size of novelette.

We paid special attention to keeping new dialogues lore-friendly and true to characters personalities, while also expanding a little bit on the world of CrossCode.

Just like in the original game, new dialogues play out after finishing combat.

# Additional features
## Reactive Dialogue

Party dialogue may have subtle changes based on which other dialogues have already played out, current story progression, active NG+ modifiers and player level.

## Extended Miscellaneous Comments

We added a few extra lines for miscellaneous events to characters, that had the least amount of them.

It mostly concerns equipment upgrade and finishing combat with S rank.

## Custom Expressions
