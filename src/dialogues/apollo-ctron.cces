Apollo > CONTENT: Truly a sight to behold.
Lea > PROUD: ...!
C'tron > THOUGHTFUL: Uhm...\. path of... justice?

Message 2

Apollo > POINTING: It is our duty as Seekers!
Lea > EXHAUSTED: ...

Message 3
Apollo > POINTING: Our enemies are vanquished once again!
Apollo > SHOUTING: Imbued with power of the Track, they test our resolve on the path to true mastery.
C'tron > WORRIED: I don't know if you can call adding guns to birds as "imbuing power"...
Lea > SMILE: ...
Apollo > DEFAULT: But it's true, Hexacast.\. It is the very same power that flows through seekers.
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Then why don't I have a jetpack growing on my back?
Apollo > PONDERING: Hmm...\. I suppose it works differently for every creature.

Message 4
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Having jetpack in CrossWords would make chest hunting less of a hussle.
Lea > EXCITED: ...!

Lea > MOPING: ...
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: That's the point...

Apollo > LECTURING: Some creatures are actually victims of evil experiments...
Apollo > POINTING: Secretly performed by \c[1]humans\c[0]!

Message 6
C'tron > DEFAULT: Humans behind such experiments must be very smart.
C'tron > SURPRISED: Cybernetics and animal uplifting are complicated concepts.
Apollo > LECTURING: Not smart enough as it seems.
Apollo > DOWN: In the end, animals managed to escape from their laboratory.
Apollo > LECTURING: We can only theorize, why and how that happened.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Intelligent birds with guns. What could possibly go wrong?

Message 7
C'tron > WORRIED: To bad real world research into uplifting was shut down.
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Scientists never managed to get approval from ACF. # Todo: Unlock ACF lore entry
Lea > SURPRISED_AWAY: Why?
