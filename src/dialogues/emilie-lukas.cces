Lukas > DEFAULT: Been some time since we played together.
Emilie > HAPPY: Oui! And I'm glad that Lea is finally back!
Lea > SURPRISED: Wait Lea?
#alternatives to “sleeping” are “offline” and “away”
Lukas > EYES_CLOSED: Jap. We all took a break from CrossWorlds, while you were...\. sleeping.
Emilie > SMILE: Silly, you thought I'd play without you?
Lea > TOUCHED: Thanks...
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: The game was also kind of out of content for us...
Lukas > EYES_CLOSED: But \c[3]you\c[0] were the main reason.

Message 2
Emilie > EXHAUSTED: Honestly, waiting for news from Sergey was the worst.
Emilie > SAD: I couldn't sleep for weeks.
Lukas > WONDERING: You also had exams approaching at a time, right?
Emilie > MOPING: Sacrebleu, who cares about stupid exams...
Emilie > EMBARRASSED: I passed them anyway...\. somehow...
Lukas > LAUGH: Well, it's good that everything turned out as it is, right?
Emilie > DETERMINED: Oui! And since we're all equally leveled, we can kick ass together!

        Emilie > EXHAUSTED: Sacrebleu, I forgot about that bug.

        Lukas > SKEPTICAL: She made it this far...\. somehow...

Message 3
Emilie > AWAY Why do they use so many instanced rooms? 
Emilie > SUSPICIOUS: Doesn't it like... defeat the purpose of MMO?
Lea > THINKING: ...
Lukas > WONDERING: Sometimes I wonder about it myself. Wouldn't it be cheaper to use less instances?
Emilie > SHRUG: Guess we'll never know.

Message 4
Lukas > DEFAULT: By the way, how did you like \c[3]that jumping puzzle\c[0] in Gaia's Garden? # Personally, I like them all. Especially the Azure Archipelago.
Emilie > EXHAUSTED: Mon Dieu, the jumping ones are bad already.
Emilie > CURIOUS: Ones where you have to hit switches on time are even worse.
Lukas > TOWARDS: Or when you have to escort a slowly traveling VRP.
Lea > EXHAUSTED: ...!
Lukas > LAUGH They always reminded me of escort quests in other RPGs. Never liked them.
Emilie > EXHAUSTED: Me neither.

Message 5
Emilie > DEFAULT: Most enemies in CrossWorlds are kind of cool.
Emilie > EMBARRASSED: Hate the flying ones though.
Lukas > LAUGH: Jap. They keep getting away if you get too close. 
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: Most of the time, it turns the fight into a waiting game.
Emilie > EXHAUSTED: It's always some dumb papagun for me.
Emilie > MOPING: He stays up high and keeps throwing stupid bananas.
Lukas > LAUGH: They are actually melons, but I know that feeling all too well.
Emilie > WATCH_OUT_BADASS: At least Lea can take care of them with her ranged attacks.
Lea > WHISTLING: ...

Message 6
Emilie > AWAY: How is your job, Lukas?
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: Project scope increased, but deadlines are left unchanged.
Lukas > DEFAULT: Meanwhile, most of the department has no clue what they are doing.
Lukas > LAUGH: You know, business as usual.
Emilie > EXHAUSTED: Oui, some things never change.

Message 7
Emilie > CURIOUS: I wonder if Lea will also get a job.
Lea > SURPRISED_AWAY: How?
Lukas > WONDERING: I'm sure Instatainment will find something for you to do.
Lea > THINKING: ...

Message 8
Lukas > DEFAULT: Just got an idea.
Lukas > WINK: Lea may perform play-testing of new content.
Emilie > CURIOUS: Like an early access?
Lea > EXCITED: ...!
Lukas > WINK: Knowing Instatainment, it's gonna be one hell of a \c[3]Long Early Access\c[0].
Lukas > WINK: Evotar-exclusive, of course.
Emilie > MOPING: Not fair! She can't even spoil it!
Lea > WHISTLING: ...!
