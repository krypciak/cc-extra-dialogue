C'tron > DEFAULT: You two hike a lot?
Joern > SMILE: Sometimes. I like mountains.
Lea > EX2_LIGHT_SMILE: Why?

Message 3
C'tron > DEFAULT: How does Bergen compare to an actual hiking trail?
Joern > DEFAULT: The view is nice, but nowhere near real life.
C'tron > THOUGHTFUL: Why? Looks quite immersive to me.
C'tron > WORRIED: If you ignore penguins, seahorses and snowmans.
Joern > DEFAULT: Climbing Bergen Trail is too easy.
Joern > TOWARD: What's the challenge if you don't get tired?
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Right...

Message 4
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: So is it a challenge, a view... or a shop?
Joern > TOWARD: Tronny, that's an obvious question.

C'tron > SMILE: That's actually quite accurate climate for a midday desert.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Though I can see, how it can be annoying for some people.

Message 1
C'tron > DEFAULT: Instatainment nailed the image of a real jungle. 
C'tron > WORRIED: Excluding animals, of course.
C'tron > SURPRISED: It's very humid, lush with vegetation and full of difficult terrain.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Although, I'd like it to be a bit more straightforward... and smaller, I guess.
Joern > DEFAULT: There are no shortcuts to any place worth going, Tronny.

Message 2

C'tron > AWESOME: Some of them existed since when \c[3]Terra\c[0] was still inhabited!
Lea > ASTONISHED: ...!
Joern > DEFAULT: Ever wondered, how would it feel to live for a thousand years?
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: As a tree, you won't feel anything at all.

Message 1

Joern > SMILE: Peaceful and relaxing, isn't it. 
Lea > NOD: [nods]

Message 2
C'tron > DOWN: Did you know that perpetual dusk is a very rare planetary anomaly?
C'tron > SURPRISED: For that to be natural, Raritan Gem must have synchronous rotation with the star.
C'tron > WORRIED: But something isn't right...\! The climate should be much more hostile.
Joern > SMILE: Relax and enjoy the atmosphere, Tronny.

Message 3
C'tron > DOWN: Almost entirety of this moon is water, yet we never see any storms or waves.
Joern > DEFAULT: Large waves would be disastrous for beach areas.
C'tron > WORRIED: And to avoid waves, Raritan Gem must be tidally locked...
Joern > DEFAULT: Sounds plausible.
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: But then it may orbit behind gas giant, blocking the light...
C'tron > BLANK: Unless...

Message 4
Joern > DEFAULT: Unless it doesn't \c[3]rotate\c[0] nor \c[3]revolve\c[0] around gas giant?
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: No, what a nonsense. That's impossibly rare.
C'Tron > DOWN: On top of that, perfectly habitable atmosphere and gravity?
C'tron > WORRIED: The water and illumination are just not real.
Lea > EXHAUSTED: ...

Message 5
C'tron > DEFAULT: There are also hundreds of instanced rooms for every player...
C'tron > WORRIED: No way they hollowed out the entire continent to built them. It's just too much terraforming.
C'tron > BLANK: That means only one thing...
Joern > DEFAULT: Tronny.
C'tron > CRAZY_PANIC: Not only water and light are fake!

Joern > EX2_TRANQUIL: Relax.

Message 6
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Okay, maybe that was a bit too crazy.
C'tron > THOUGHTFUL: Raritan Gem is real. There are ships with maintenance crew after all.
C'tron > WORRIED: But illumination... it's clearly artificial...\. like every other special effect.
Joern > TOWARD: What if moon is also artificial? 
Joern > SARCASTIC: Like, all metal on the inside?
