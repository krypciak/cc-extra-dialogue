Joern > TOWARD: Activated charcoal?
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: Not sure.\. Maybe?
Joern > ANGRY: How irresponsible. You can't just eat random pills, Lukas.
Lukas > DEFAULT: Don't worry. I've been taking them for years and so far they seem to help.
Lukas > LAUGH: No adverse side-effects detected.

Message 3
Lukas > WHISTLING: Hold on, I think there is one more slice left.

Lea > SHAKE_EYE_CLOSED: [shakes head]
Lea > ANGRY: Why?

Message 1
Lukas > WONDERING: Isn't CrossGear connected to all five senses?
Joern > DEFAULT: \c[3]Taste\c[0] and \c[3]smell\c[0] are missing.
Lukas > WHISTLING: But that's the thing, Joern.
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: They are not missing, just disabled.
Lea > SURPRISED: Why?
Joern > DEFAULT: Safety precaution?
Lukas > LAUGH: Most likely they decided that designing hedgehags taste was to much effort.

Message 2
Joern > DEFAULT: How do you know they are actually disabled?
Joern > TOWARD: Maybe CrossGear can't physically support them.
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: We have \c[3]touch\c[0]. How different is it from taste anyway.
Joern > SARCASTIC: Enough to be considered a separate sense.

Message 3
Lukas > DEFAULT: Hey, Joern.
Lukas > WHISTLING: If \c[3]taste\c[0] actually worked in CrossWorlds, what would you lick first?
Joern > ANGRY: Nothing.\. That's unsanitary.
Lukas > COMPLAINING: Tell that to an average player.
Lukas > TOWARDS: They will immediately lick the first jelly blob they spot.
Lea > SHAKE_EYE_CLOSED: [shakes head]
Joern > DEFAULT: Or a snowman.
Lukas > LAUGH: Ja.\. Tronny would definitely do that one.

Lea > THINKING: ...
Lea > SHAKE: [shakes head]
Joern > AWWW: Poor little girl.
Lea > SURPRISED_TOWARD: Why?
Lukas > COMPLAINING: Well... until you ate a burger, you'll never know what you're missing out on.

Message 5
Lukas > SURPRISED: I just had the best idea ever...
Joern > DEFAULT: Go on.
Lukas > WINK: Forget snowman and blobs!\. Imagine, if you could \c[3]taste\c[0] food in CrossWorlds!
Lea > ASTONISHED: ...!
Lukas > LAUGH: Any dish you can imagine, instant preparation time, infinitely scale-able!
Joern > SMILE: Rhombus restaurants. Lovely.
Lukas > WINK: Easy money. I should pitch this to Sergey!
Sergey > ROLL_EYES: We read these kinds of suggestions every day.
Sergey > SERIOUS: Satoshi left before finishing the \c[3]taste buds\c[0] module. 
Sergey > WORRIED: And people who can improve CrossGear are not that common.
Lea > SAD: ...
Sergey > THINKING: But since he is back...\! Guess, I'll ask him about it.
Lea > EXCITED: ...!
