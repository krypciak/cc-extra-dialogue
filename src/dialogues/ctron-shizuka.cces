Lea > SMILE: ...
C'tron > TOWARD: Are you sure about that?

Message 5
C'tron > SURPRISED: Experiencing major events may cause changes in personality.
C'tron > SMILE: But your preferences should still be \c[3]99% identical\c[0].
Shizuka > BADASS: Oh really?
C'tron > AWESOME: Yes! For example, your tastes remained similar!
C'tron > SMUG: You both prefer meat over fish in bento.
Lea > NOD: [nods]
Shizuka > SURPRISED: ...

C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Uhm...\. lucky guess?
Shizuka > EX2_SUSPICIOUS: Uh huh...

Message 6
Shizuka > DEFAULT: How did you figure it out?
C'tron > SURPRISED: I saw bento in your name.
C'tron > DOWN: And Lea prefers meat over fish-based consumables.
Shizuka > SARCASTIC: Seriously? From in-game consumables?
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: That's really it.
Sergey > SERIOUS: Lea. I think you should keep these two \c[3]away from each other\c[0].
Sergey > DRAMATIC: Or their conversation can get heated real quick.

Message 6
Shizuka > DEFAULT: Have we met before, Tronny?
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: N-no, I'm confident you've never seen me.
Shizuka > SARCASTIC: Strange...\. I sense something very familiar about you.
Lea > SURPRISED_AWAY: ...?
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: I ugh... just said the same thing about you and Lea.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED:  Maybe you've met a \c[3]real player\c[0] from whom I was created?
Shizuka > INNOCENT: Not sure. Maybe...\. maybe not.
Shizuka > FUNNY_SMILE: I'll let my subconsciousness figure it out.
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Okay-dokey...

Message 7
Shizuka > EVIL_GRIN: No...\. of course we've never met before.
Shizuka > DENYING: I've never paid much attention to avatars in vermillion dump.
Shizuka > SARCASTIC: Which you should remember by the way...\. you know... being \c[3]Evotar\c[0] and all that.
Lea > EX2_NERVOUS_GLANCE: ...
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Uhm... n-no, sorry...\. I don't remember being to vermillion.
C'tron > PONDERING: Maybe I was created right before that place got shut down.
Shizuka > DEFAULT: You're one lucky kid then, Tronny.
C'tron > SAD: ...

Message 8
Shizuka > SARCASTIC: It wasn't in the briefing though, was it?
C'tron > THOUGHTFUL: What exactly?

C'tron > THOUGHTFUL: Oh, uhm... he actually did.
Sergey > DRAMATIC: Lea...

Message 9
Shizuka > DENYING: Maybe I'm hallucinating again.
C'tron > THOUGHTFUL: Again? It that... normal?
Shizuka > SARCASTIC: Happens when you live on the razor edge for two years.

Message 10
Shizuka > SARCASTIC: Now I get it.
Lea > SURPRISED_TOWARD: ...?
Shizuka > SARCASTIC: It was your manner of speech, Tronny.
Shizuka > DENYING: Reminds me of \c[1]Sidwell\c[0]. The one, who started all this mess.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: That's not concerning in the slightest.
Shizuka > DENYING: Don't worry. Just an unlucky coincidence.

Message 11
C'tron > SURPRISED: What happened to Sidwell?
Shizuka > CONCERNED: Nothing...

Lea > SURPRISED_TOWARD: Why?
Shizuka > DENYING: ...
Shizuka > EX2_DISAPPOINTED: It's nothing urgent.
Lea > ANNOYED: ...\.Why?
Shizuka > SMUG: Just family business.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Oh, alright then.
C'tron > SMILE: I'll gladly \c[3]leave you two alone\c[0], if you need a moment.
Lea > NOD: [nods]
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Gosh, hope it's not about what happened earlier.
