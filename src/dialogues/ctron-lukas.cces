Lukas > LAUGH: Aw, man! Been a while since I've played with a proper hexacast.
Lukas > DEFAULT: Your buffs are super useful for Tribladers.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Uhm... I guess...
C'tron > TOWARD: But I am not the only Hexacast in your guild, correct?
Lukas > COMPLAINING: Yeah, but... when I need his help, Albert usually ends up busy.
Lea > SURPRISED_TOWARD: Why?
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: You know, he is just always... busy... with stuff.

Message 2
Lukas > WONDERING: Hey, Tronny. Are you feeling alright?
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Mostly yes... just my mind is a little foggy.
C'tron > SMILE: No need to worry about it.
Lukas > SURPRISED: Oh, ok.
Lukas > LAUGH: I've noticed you were reluctant to use some abilities, that's all.
Lea > SMILE: ...

Message 3
Lukas > DEFAULT: You lot didn't forget to spend your \c[3]circuit points\c[0], right?

C'tron > SMILE: Of course... kind of hard to forget it.
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: Then you surely have \c[3]Divine Protection\c[0] unlocked, Tronny. Give it a shot.
C'tron > SURPRISED: Is it like a... defensive art?
Lukas > LAUGH:  Jap. Surprised you don't throw it more often.
Lukas > TOWARDS: For a \c[3]level 1\c[0], it's surprisingly good. Albert uses it all the time.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Okay-dokey.

Message 4
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: Not a fan of protective arts, are you?
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: It's a lot to keep track of.
C'tron > SURPRISED: I'm not sure about which elemental protection to cast.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: And by the time I've figured it out, Lea already destroyed all enemies.
Lea > WHISTLING: ...!
# Better fix the tauthology / repetition in next two lines
Lukas > LAUGH: Makes sense, if you rarely used them before.
Lukas > DEFAULT: Don't worry about elements. Just throw \c[3]Sharpening Flames\c[0] next time we get in a fight.
Lukas > WHISTLING: It's the \c[3]heat\c[0] version if you're wondering.
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Sure, I'll try to remember that.

Message 5
Lukas > COMPLAINING: ...Tronny.
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Right... sorry...
C'tron > EMBARRASSED: I ugh... I think, I just don't like protective arts.
Lukas > SKEPTICAL: They give more than just resistances, you know.
Lukas > DEFAULT: For example, \c[3]Sharpening Flames\c[0] also grants significant increase to \c[3]attack\c[0] stat.
if newgame.sergey-hax
    Lukas > COMPLAINING: Maybe with it I'll manage to kill at least something.
    Lea > INSANE_DOWN: \c[1]...!
    C'tron > EMBARRASSED: Right...

    Lukas > WINK: I think, Lea would appreciate such buff. Bigger numbers never hurt.
    Lea > NOD_HAPPY: [nods]
    C'tron > WORRIED: Right...

Message 6
Lukas > RANTING: Oh Junge, guess Albert was right.
Lukas > SERIOUS: You're just terrible at this game.
Lea > NOD: [nods]
C'tron > EXHAUSTED: Sorry.
Lukas > TOWARDS: Just kidding, don't worry about it.
Lukas > LAUGH: It's not like we need buffs at this point anyway.
if newgame.sergey-hax
    Lea > INSANE_DOWN: \c[1]...!
    Lukas > SKEPTICAL: Like I said...

    Lukas > WINK: Lea can take care of enemies just fine.
    Lea > SMUG: Hi.
